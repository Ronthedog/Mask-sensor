# Mask-sensor
Using TensorFlow
I am trying to create a machine that senses whether you are wearing a mask or not. 
GOALS
Create the machine before 30 June
Make it workable.
Use as many as off the shelf components as possible.
Write code in TF (every language is welcome :D)

Please help everybody. Make forks , give code , Create components . Just don't ask for donations until this thing gets complete.
